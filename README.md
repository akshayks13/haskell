## How to Run Code Using `ghci`

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and `ghci` (the interactive environment) installed. You can install them using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/):

1. Open a terminal.

2. Start the GHC interactive environment:

```bash
ghci
````

3. Load the desired Haskell file using `:load` (or `:l`):

```haskell
:l filename.hs
```

Example:

```haskell
:l recursion.hs
```

4. Call the function you want to test:

```haskell
factorial 5
```

5. To reload after making changes:

```haskell
:r
```

6. To exit `ghci`:

```haskell
:quit
```

or press `Ctrl + D`.
